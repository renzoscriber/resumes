## CJ's Freelancing Adivce

1. Never take anything/changes personal. We all have opinions but the client's opinion counts the most because they are paying the bill. That doesn't mean you should agree with everything but pick your battles and know when to cave. 
2. Clients hire you for one of two reasons: they respect yoru work or your cheap. Go for the ones that have respect. 
3. Decide on an hourly you want and an hourly rate you can live with.
4. Keep track of the hours you spend on each project so you know how to bid the next one. Bid future projects on what you want, not what you need.
5. Never drop yoru price more than 30% because clients will think you were trying to screw them with your initial bid.
6. Never do anything for free unless it's for an existing client that has already exhibited loyalty or for a person/charity that you believe in.

### 5 Practical Tips

1. The "perfect" summary length = 2,000 characters

   Example:

   ```markdown
   Award-Winning Data Analyst with 3+ eyars in teh healthcare space. I help healthcare systems like HCA healthcare and NEw York Presbyterian Hospitals use dta to lower readmission rates by 30%.
   
   Technical Skills & Tools: Python, R, SQL, mongodb, Tableau, & PowerBi
   
   Here are a few samples of my work:\
   	- Bullet 1
   	- Bullet 2
   	- Bullet 3
   
   Analyszed 100,000+ patient records to identify specifc procedures with teh highest readmission rate, resulting in 15% decrease in patient readmission for the following calendar eyar. Developed visualization of readmission rates and total costs per procedure for HCA health system, enabling executives to report out and act on rising readmission rates and costs. Additionally, I am a big college basketball fan (go Georegtown). In that vein, I created da site called AnalysedMadness.com wehre I build predictive models for the annual NCAA basketball Tournament based on current and historical stats. 
   
   I get excited about opportunities where I'm able to leverage big data to discovery insights and identify patterns that have real human impact.

2. Embed the right keywords in your LinkedIn summary (important for jobs your specifically want)

   - [ ] Find a role you are interested in on Indeed
   - [ ] Copy and paste entire LinkedIn job descriptions into a word document for 20 different jobs that fit your role of interest
   - [ ] Copy and paste everything in the word document into a world cloud generator (recommends Monkey Learn Word Cloud Generator)
   - [ ] Do your best to weave the top five keywords into your LinkedIn summary 

3. Use Unicode Text Converter to bold or italicize words in your LinkedIn summary

4. Bring up one or two personal interests

   ``` 
   General interest (specific detail)
   ```

   E.g., your general interest could be physics and your specific detail could be quantum mechanics 

5. Use the Hemingway app to check grammar and spelling
