## Career Break 
### Description
Independently acquiring new skills in coding and updating knowledge in mathematics and physics. I'm still very much of a neophyte when it comes to coding and physics, however my background in neuroscience has provided me with enough experience in these subjects that I feel confident in pursuing them. For some reason, I just can't resist the urge to answer the calling of physics. I am hoping to orient my career in its present state in a way that increases the probability I will one day wake up and find myself back at a university typing up a dissertation I was meant to pursue. However, as long as I get to use my skill sets and share my enthusiasm for science, I am eager to see what I reap from the professional seeds I have sown over the years.
